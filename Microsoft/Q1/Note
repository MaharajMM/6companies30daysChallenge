Reverse polish notation = Post fix notation. So here, we will get the operands first and then the operators.

1. We use a stack to store all the operands.
2. We store all the operands in the order we receive it in.
3. If we get an operator, we operate it on the previous two operands.
4. We store the resultant operand as it will be used for future operations.

So the algorithm is:

If the character is a number (operand), push it into the stack
If the character is an operator,
Pop the top two operands (numbers) from the stack.
Find the result of the operation using the operator
Push the result back in the stack
After traversal, the top of the stack will be the result of evaluated reverse polish expression.
